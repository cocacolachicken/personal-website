            Hello reader! I'm a future CS major (still undecided on what
            university I currently want to attend). Other than coding, I love minimalism,
            math contest problems, and late-century sci-fi. I'm quiet in public but lively with friends.

            I've always hated how reminder apps only had options to remind you about its reminders
            instead of reminding you about the existence of the list itself. Perminder is an app that
            does the latter and allows for a daily or weekly schedule. I was in charge of creating the frontend
            components and structuring the app.

            A desktop app that shows the weather and displays pretty animations, taken from
            the <a href="https://eccc-msc.github.io/open-data/">Meteorological Service of Canada's
            Open Data website.</a> It was created using a JavaFX wrapper that works similarly
            to p5.js. I created the whole project besides the JavaFX wrapper â€” the graphics, the
            data fetcher, and structuring the project.
